**Example compiler for SScript**

* TODO: combine st (states) and v (variables)
   (There is no reason why we would need both of them
   & states [constants] are faster to access if they
   are stored as variables. This takes up a few memory
   places but not that many (unless one uses up to
   hundreds of states in one program, which is not
   recommended))
